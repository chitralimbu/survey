# survey
A survey I created for my dissertation

Uses HTML and CSS to create the survey. PHP and MySQL to gather and store data.
Survey.php is the main website where people were asked to take the survey. 
The colouranalysis.php and feelinganalyis.php collates the data and prints out the results. 

The purpose of this was to determine what kinds of colours and feelings people would choose
depending on the BPM/ key of the music. 

This helped determine the final output of "visualisation of music". Which was
created using Python 3 and MusicXML.
MUSIC XML: http://www.musicxml.com/
